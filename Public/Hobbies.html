    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>I try to make time to sew at least once a week, and because I'm fairly new to programming, I'm always trying to make time to test and develop new things on the IT front.
    </p>
    <p>Other than the above I still have a full time job as an operations manager and trying to balance everything is a hobby on it's own.</p>
